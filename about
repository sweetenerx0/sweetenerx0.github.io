  <h1>About Dani</h1>
  <p class="center-link">So who is Dani?<br>I'm currently a junior trying to get my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I love to program the most out of all the sectors of computer science, but do have experience in cloud-based network setup,ethical hacking, along with digital forensics. <br>
Professionally, I would love to work towards aviation programming, as I have a strong interest in jets and see it is a great way to innovate and create for future technologies</p>
