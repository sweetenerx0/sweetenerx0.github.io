  <h1>What I've been doing</h1>
  <p>Right now, I am working on a projectile on top of school work, including:
    <br> -learning MATLABS<br> -learning model figuring in Blender
    <br> -and making this website to document my journey. 
  </p>
  <p> I plan on creating a model figure of a Lockheed Martin F117 and using that as my projectile in my MATLABS projectile motion simulator.<br> A lot of this is self taught, meaning I am having to use books, the Internet, online forums from 11 years ago, and AI to review my code.</p>
  <p>Since I am a student, I have a class this semester in Java programming and a class on Digital Forensics, both of which I enjoy so very much. I wasn't always the best in English classes or math, but being able to create digitally brings me so much joy. </p>
